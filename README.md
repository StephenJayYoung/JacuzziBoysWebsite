Dude I'm loving the JBAC website idea.  I'm thinking of something really simple, as well as something that would be easy for me to update posts to.  I like this website a lot - although I have no clue how difficult it would be to make.

For the three tabs, we could just have "HOME", "ATHLETES", and "CONTACT".

It would be cool to also have the instagram and twitter feeds auto-populate like the above url has.
