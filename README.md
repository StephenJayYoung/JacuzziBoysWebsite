Dude I'm loving the JBAC website idea.  I'm thinking of something really simple, as well as something that would be easy for me to update posts to.  I like this website a lot - although I have no clue how difficult it would be to make.

For the three tabs, we could just have "HOME", "ATHLETES", and "CONTACT".

It would be cool to also have the instagram and twitter feeds auto-populate like the above url has.

Let me know what you think.  Also, I am more than willing to pay the domain/hosting, let me know when you need me to do that.  I'll also get you a case of beer for your trouble.   

If you want to meet up to go over any specifics, let me know.
